# Loyola Energy Data Project

## Introduction
Loyola University Maryland is seeking to deepen its commitment to sustainability as a Jesuit, Laudato Si' university. After submitting our first STARS report, Loyola received a Bronze sustainability rating, but we are ambitiously seeking a platinum rating by 2030 as a part of our "*Together we rise*" action plan.  

If Loyola is going to achieve this platinum rating, it needs a consolidated and comprehensive inventory of the energy usage of all buildings on campus. This project seeks to fulfill that need, and build clear visualizations that make this data accessible to school decision-makers.

I'm Finley Costello, I'm a Data Science major and Political Science minor in the class of 2025, and I'm the Energy/Water Management Intern at Loyola's Office of Sustainability.
